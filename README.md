# 🌟 Simple Glyph Composer (ツ)

Bring your Nothing Phone's tones to life with light and sound! This side project is my attempt to add a fun and creative twist to my Nothing Phone (1) experience. As an already overworked developer, I put this together in my spare time, so any help is greatly appreciated. With this app, you can craft custom ringtones from your favorite audio files and synchronize them with the light patterns on the back of your Nothing phone, known as "Glyphs".

## 🚀 Features

- **Load Audio Files**: Import your favorite `.mp3` or `.ogg` files to start creating.
- **Media Controls**: Easily play, pause, stop, and seek through your audio tracks.
- **Glyph Editing**: Customize Glyphs with an intuitive editor that feels like a professional timeline tool.
- **Interactive Glyph Blocks**:
  - Add as many glyph blocks as you'd like
  - Don't like a glyph block? Delete it.
  - Drag to move a block around
  - Select to Trim and adjust
- **Visual Navigation**: Scroll to explore your glyph edits on track effortlessly.

## 🎨 How to Use (Instructions)

1. **Load Your Audio**:

   - Start by loading your audio file (supports `.mp3` and `.ogg` formats).

2. **Edit Glyphs**:

   - **Double tap** on the track to add a Glyph block.
   - **Right click** on a block to delete it.
   - **Drag** from the left side to move, or from the right to resize.
   - **Select** and select right trim handle to trim and adjust
   - **Scroll** right and left (x-axis) to explore your track effortlessly.

3. **Save Your Creation**:

   - Click the save icon (floppy disk), rename your file (make sure it ends with `.ogg`), and save it.

4. **Apply Your Ringtone**:
   - Open the official Composer app from Nothing.
   - Go to 'Library' via the 3-dash icon (make sure you have existing recordings for the icon to appear).
   - Use the top-right 3-dot menu to import your saved file.
   - Scroll to the top of 'Library' if you can’t find your file, preview it, and set it as your default ringtone.
